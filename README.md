## The Weather App
In this mobile web application, we are going build our own weather app. We are going to use the free tier from openweathermap.org. The free API's can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/price#weather, near the bottom of the page.

Using the 5 day weather forecast (https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 to show each day's weather.

There is an example attached to show you a representation of the solution could be.

The top section should have today's weather (temperature, high/low, an image of what the weather representation is for today) The bottom section has the 5 day forecast.

## Requirements
Have a zip code lookup to search for weather.
Have a menu item or link in your app that allows the user to see previous zip codes that were used. If I pick one of them, do a fresh query on the weather forecast.
